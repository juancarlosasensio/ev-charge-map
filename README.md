# React.js app with Express.js backend

HN-Lite shows you HN's front page by default and lets you search for news in HN's archive. Built with React, Express.js and [HN's Algolia API](https://hn.algolia.com/api), and deployed on Vercel.

[@elze](https://github.com/elze) paved the way with a great [repo](https://github.com/elze/vercel-express-react-demo) and [presentation](http://geekitude.com/Presentations/20211205-Vercel-Express-React/20211208-Vercel.html#/).
